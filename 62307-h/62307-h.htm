</div>

<p>“I <span class="smcap">will</span> not try any more. Everything goes wrong to-day,” exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>Charley Morris, throwing down his slate in a pet.</p>

<p>“Nothing succeeds that I try to do. Everything turns out just the wrong
way.”</p>

<p>“I want you to run and get me the book,” said his mother, “which I left
on the seat at the farther end of the garden; then afterwards we will
see if anything can be done to coax events into a better humour.”</p>

<p>Charley returned with his face a little brighter from a moment’s
exercise in the fresh air, and seated himself at his mother’s feet.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in unlucky days, mother?” said he.</p>

<p>“I do not believe they come very often,” said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>“But how can you help their coming, mother?”</p>

<p>“Treat them in such a way when they occur that they will not return very
soon. But now I want you to tell me what has made this day ‘unlucky,’
and then perhaps I can tell you what to do about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, mother, I overslept myself this morning, and was late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>at breakfast. That put me out. Then Agnes laughed at me for being so
late, and that made me cross.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image04.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Stop a moment, my dear, and notice where your ‘unlucky day’ began. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span>trifling error in being late in rising cannot excuse the greater fault
of ill-temper. A single act of self control might have altered the
course of the whole day.”</p>

<p>“Then, mother, I went to school feeling just as cross; I thought I had
all my lessons perfectly; but when I got to school, I found I had
learned the wrong spelling-lesson, and that provoked me a little more,
but I set to work to learn the right one. While in the midst of that,
the arithmetic class was called. I had studied the lesson thoroughly
last night, but somehow the spelling, or being provoked, or something
else, had put it all out of my head, so that I missed ever so many
questions: and, to end it all, I have got twelve extra examples to work
out at home. I cannot do them; it is no use trying to do anything on
such days.”</p>

<p>There was a pause of a few moments, and then his mother said:</p>

<p>“Charley, you like to read the histories of great soldiers and heroes of
old times, such as Alexander, and Cæsar, and Napoleon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p><p>“Yes, mother, very much.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me, when do you like Alexander best&mdash;feasting at Babylon&mdash;or
in action, commanding his army, attacking the enemy, and gaining
victories?”</p>

<p>“I like him best in action, mother, of course.”</p>

<p>“True, we like bravery better than cowardice. When do you like best to
read of Napoleon&mdash;imprisoned at St. Helena, or at the beginning of his
course with difficulties around him, but rising above them all by his
strength of will?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like him best in the beginning, mother,” said Charley, with
kindled enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“But,” said Mrs. Morris, “suppose he could have marched by a smooth
road, straight from France to Italy.”</p>

<p>“Why, he would not have been a hero at all, if he had not something to
conquer.”</p>

<p>“And the will to conquer it,” added Mrs. Morris with a smile. “ That is
just what I want you to notice. We cannot imitate, if we would, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>precise actions of these great conquerors; but we <i>can</i> copy their
energy and strength of purpose, and our daily life furnishes
opportunities to cultivate these qualities.”</p>

<p>“I do not see how, mother.”</p>

<p>“The life of a little school-boy presents some difficulties&mdash;does it
not, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” he replied, glancing ruefully at his Arithmetic.</p>

<p>“Then <i>there</i> is something to conquer, and in the conquest you can grow
strong and brave. Like Napoleon <i>you</i> can never be a hero, unless you
have some obstacles to overcome.”</p>

<p>“I wish the difficulties would not always come when I feel so cross.”</p>

<p>“The crossness is the very first thing you need to conquer. There is a
proverb on that subject: “He that is slow to anger, is better than the
mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.”</p>

<p>“That is an important thing to remember,” said Mrs. Morris. “If we are
ever to attain anything great or good in life, our career of conquest
must begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> in our own hearts. Until all unruly feelings and passions
are under control, our efforts toward knowledge, or anything else that
is worth the winning, will be of little avail. What people call adverse
fate, is the result of their own faults and failings.”</p>

<p>“Do you think one can always help feeling unpleasantly, mother?”</p>

<p>“I think one can learn either to put down all disagreeable feelings, or
to work bravely on and never mind them. But what lessons do you most
frequently have trouble with, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Oh! this arithmetic, mother, it is the only thing that troubles me.”</p>

<p>“I will write on your book, two mottos which I wish you to look at,
whenever you are fretted, or discouraged by difficulties. The first
is:&mdash;‘Every boy may be a hero.’ And that you may remember what sort of
heroism is to be sought, I will add this verse: ‘<i>He that ruleth his
spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city</i>.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
